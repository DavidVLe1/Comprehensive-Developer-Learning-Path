# Comprehensive-Developer-Learning-Path
This document serves as a collaborative guide for aspiring developers to navigate through various stages of software development, deployment, and infrastructure management.

## Advice and next steps
- The next step after Demo day should be to:
  1. Creating test cases for your app
  2. Look into containerization and Docker.
  3. Start looking into deploying your app outside of fly and render such as on azure or cloud afterwards.
  4. Rebuild your app in a different language or build an app in a different language. (Java or Python or Golang).
     - Statically Typed Languages: Java, C, C++, and Go.
     - Dynamically Typed Languages: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.
     - Sumit Tokkar suggested trying out Golang.
  6. Learn more about authentication and authorization
  7. Learn Terraform tool which is used in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and know what IaC is.
  8. Look into Github Actions! Does CI/CD.
     - CI/CD is important! When you push your code into main branch, there will be a separate workflow to check test cases and then if it checks out then it deploys it.
